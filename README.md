Credit Card Approval Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict credit card approval decisions based on various features related to credit history, financial information, and personal details of applicants. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected by the issuing authority.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical credit card application data, including both approved and rejected applications. It includes features such as applicant's age, income, credit score, employment status, debt-to-income ratio, and more.

The dataset is stored in the data directory and is split into two files: credit_card_applications.csv and credit_card_labels.csv. The credit_card_applications.csv file contains the feature data, while the credit_card_labels.csv file contains the corresponding labels (0 for rejected and 1 for approved).

Requirements
To run the code and reproduce the results, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
